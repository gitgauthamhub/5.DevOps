==============

Permissions
Permissions define who can access a file or directory and what actions they can perform (read, write, or execute). 
Permissions are a core part of Linuxâ€™s security model, controlling access for users, groups, and others.

======================
R -> 4,    W -> 2,   X -> 1

-			rw-		r--		r--

file/		user/   group	others

owner

directory     u       g       o

ec2-user   ec2-user

user		   group
======================

$ touch devops.txt
ls -l

$ chmod ugo+w devops.txt
$ chmod 700 devops.txt

>> Only Owner/Root user can change the permissions

Ownership
Ownership refers to the user and group associated with a file or directory, Note : Now change User/Group ownership 

chown <user>:<group> devops.txt

Change the path
$ cd /tmp/
ls -l

$ touch aws.txt
ls -l            

$ sudo useradd gautham
ls -l
$ chown  // it will not work bcz file ownership can only be modified by root user

$ sudo chown gautham aws.txt
ls -l
